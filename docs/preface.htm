                            <p> A linguistic corpus is a
                              collection of texts which
                              have been selected and
                              brought together so that
                              language can be studied on
                              the computer. Today, corpus
                              linguistics offers some of
                              the most powerful new
                              procedures for the analysis
                              of language, and the impact
                              of this dynamic and
                              expanding sub-discipline is
                              making itself felt in many
                              areas of language study.</p>
                            <p>In this volume, a selection
                              of leading experts in
                              various key areas of corpus
                              construction offer advice in
                              a readable and largely
                              non-technical style to help
                              the reader to ensure that
                              their corpus is well
                              designed and fit for the
                              intended purpose.</p>
                            <p>This Guide is aimed at those
                              who are at some stage of
                              building a linguistic
                              corpus. Little or no
                              knowledge of corpus
                              linguistics or computational
                              procedures is assumed,
                              although it is hoped that
                              more advanced users will
                              also find the guidelines
                              here useful. It also has
                              relevance for those who are
                              not building a corpus, but
                              who need to know something
                              about the issues involved in
                              the design of corpora in
                              order to choose between
                              available resources and to
                              help draw conclusions from
                              their analysis.</p>
                            <p>Increasing numbers of
                              researchers are seeing the
                              potential benefits of the
                              use of an electronic corpus
                              as a source of empirical
                              language data for their
                              research. Until now, where
                              did they find out about how
                              to build a corpus? There is
                              a great deal of useful
                              information available which
                              covers principles of corpus
                              design and development, but
                              it is dispersed in
                              handbooks, reports,
                              monographs, journal articles
                              and sometimes only in the
                              heads of experienced
                              practitioners. This Guide is
                              an attempt to draw together
                              the experience of corpus
                              builders into a single
                              source, as a starting point
                              for obtaining advice and
                              guidance on good practice in
                              this field. It aims to bring
                              together some key elements
                              of the experience learned,
                              over many decades, by
                              leading practitioners in the
                              field and to make it
                              available to those
                              developing corpora today.</p>
                            <p>The modest aim of this Guide
                              is to take readers through
                              the basic first steps
                              involved in creating a
                              corpus of language data in
                              electronic form for the
                              purpose of linguistic
                              research. While some
                              technical issues are
                              covered, this Guide does not
                              aim to offer the latest
                              information on digitisation
                              techniques. Rather, the
                              emphasis is on the
                              principles, and readers are
                              invited to refer to other
                              sources, such as the latest
                              AHDS information papers, for
                              the latest advice on
                              technologies. In addition to
                              the first chapter on the
                              principles of corpus design,
                              Professor Sinclair has also
                              provided a more practical
                              guide to building a corpus,
                              which is added as an
                              appendix to the Guide. This
                              should help guide the user
                              through some of the more
                              specific decisions that are
                              likely to be involved in
                              building a corpus.</p>
                            <p>Alert readers will see that
                              there are areas where the
                              authors are not in accord
                              with each other. It is for
                              the reader to weigh up the
                              advantages of each approach
                              for his own particular
                              project, and to decide which
                              course to follow. This Guide
                              does not aim to synthesize the
                              advice offered by the
                              various practitioners into a
                              single approach to creating
                              corpora. The information on
                              good practice which is
                              sampled here comes from a
                              variety of sources,
                              reflecting different
                              research goals, intellectual
                              traditions and theoretical
                              orientations. The individual
                              authors were asked to state
                              their opinion on what they
                              think is the best way to
                              deal with the relevant
                              aspects of developing a
                              corpus, and neither the
                              authors nor the editor have
                              tried to hide the
                              differences in approaches
                              which inevitably exist. It
                              is anticipated that readers
                              of this document will have
                              differing backgrounds, will
                              have very diverse aims and
                              objectives, will be dealing
                              with a variety of different
                              languages and varieties, and
                              that one single approach
                              would not fit them all.</p>
                            <p> I would like to thank the
                              authors of this volume for

                              to this venture, and for
                              their patience through the
                              long period it has taken to
                              bring the Guide to
                              publication. I would like to
